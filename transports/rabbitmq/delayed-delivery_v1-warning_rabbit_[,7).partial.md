WARN: This version of the RabbitMQ transport is using the older v1 version of the delay infrastructure that prefixes the queues and exchanges with `nsb` instead of `nsb.v2`. This version relies on classic queues and can lose messages. It is recommended to upgrade to version of the transport that includes the v2 infrastructure based on quorum queues. See the [upgrade guide](/transports/upgrades/rabbitmq-6to7.md#new-version-of-the-delay-infrastructure) for more details.
