## .NET Framwork no longer supported

TBD

## SendOptions changes

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/compare/release-8.1...master#diff-2c08aef8335f8f17ba3dc362fe939f8a5bdddde4f411d06a067882ac204fa43eR487 (TBD remove)

The indication that a message was marked for [immediate dispatch](/nservicebus/messaging/send-a-message.md#dispatching-a-message-immediately) has been renamed, instead of:

snippet: core-8to9-immediate-dispatch-old

Use:

snippet: core-8to9-immediate-dispatch-new

## DataBus interface changes

Starting with NServiceBus version 8, it is mandatory to provide a serializer to the data bus configuration API. The `BinaryFormatterDataBusSerializer` has been removed and `SystemJsonDataBusSerializer` is the default option that's built-in.

## Message interfaces moved to a separate package

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/compare/release-8.1...master#diff-2c08aef8335f8f17ba3dc362fe939f8a5bdddde4f411d06a067882ac204fa43eL520 (TBD remove)

Proposed action: Write something

## Extensionpoint for non task based notifications has been deprecated

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/compare/release-8.1...master#diff-2c08aef8335f8f17ba3dc362fe939f8a5bdddde4f411d06a067882ac204fa43eR250 (TBD remove)

Propose action: Don't mention this since the only use case was already deprecated in v8, see /nservicebus/upgrades/7to8/#error-notification-events and no downstream is using this API (there could be end users extending this though but that feels very unlikely?)

## Databus property is no longer marked as serializable

`[System.Serializable]` was removed

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/compare/release-8.1...master#diff-2c08aef8335f8f17ba3dc362fe939f8a5bdddde4f411d06a067882ac204fa43eR162 (TBD remove)

Proposed action: Do not mention since this api is only for internal use

## Audit context no longer accept time to be received

https://github.com/Particular/NServiceBus/compare/release-8.1...master#diff-2c08aef8335f8f17ba3dc362fe939f8a5bdddde4f411d06a067882ac204fa43eR79 (TBD remove)
