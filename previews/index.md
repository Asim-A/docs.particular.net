Particular Previews are [production-supported](support-policy.md) components that are a introduced through the Particular Preview Program. This program was created to make it easier for Particular Software to advance new capabilities to the Particular Platform while improving user involvement, validating user interest in those capabilities, and increasing the rate at which new capabilities can be adopted.

Preview components are [licensed separately](https://particular.net/eula/previews) from the rest of the Particular Platform. This license permits use of the Preview component in production until the first commercial version is released.

NOTE: Some components cannot be used independently of the NServiceBus and the Particular Platform, which requires a commercial license to use in Production.

Verified customer usage in production is key to decide whether to release a commercial version of the component. Once a preview is launched, a preview runs for a period of time while customer adoption is measured. If successful, the preview will transition into a fully adopted capability of the Particular Platform. Previews that do not generate sufficient interest will either be reworked or offered via an [open-source license](support-policy.md#time-limits) to any adopters.

Leading up to the launch of a new preview, in order to help ensure the success of the preview, a research process is undertaken to identify and validate customer needs and determine the most important features that are required to meet those needs.

User feedback is central to the Preview Program, so the more feedback is received, the better the end result will be.
