Particular Previews are [production-supported](support-policy.md) components that are a introduced through the Particular Preview Program. This program was created to make it easier for Particular Software to advance new components to the Particular Platform while improving user involvement, validating user interest in those components, and increasing the rate at which new components can be adopted.

Preview components are offered under a more [permissive license](https://particular.net/eula/previews) than the rest of the Particular Platform. This license permits use of the Preview component in production until the first commercial version is released.

NOTE: Some components cannot be used independently of the NServiceBus and the Particular Platform, which requires a commercial license to use in Production.

Verified customer usage in production is a key component for when to release the commercial version of the component. Once a preview is launched, a preview period continues until we have reached sufficient customer adoption, after which the preview will transition into a fully adopted component of the Particular Platform.

Leading up to the launch of a new preview, in order to help ensure adoption of the preview, a research process is undertaken to identify and validate customer needs and determine the most important component features that are required to meet those needs.

User feedback is central to the Preview Program, so the more feedback is received, the better the end result will be.
